<h1 align="center">🎫​ Ticket Booking System 🚌</h1>

## Description 🌟

This project involves the development of services for a ticket booking system for a passenger transport company. The system is built using Java and follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, ensuring high-quality code through rigorous testing.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- ☕​ **Java**: The primary programming language used for development.
- ✅ **JUnit**: For unit testing and ensuring code reliability.
- 🎭 **EasyMock**: To create mock objects for testing purposes.
- 🔄 **TDD Methodology**: Implemented using the **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR** phases.

## TDD Process 🔄

1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write a test for a new feature that fails (since the feature isn’t implemented yet).
2. 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Implement the minimal code necessary to pass the test.
3. 🔵 **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve the code structure while keeping the tests passing.

## In conclusion 🔚 

This project has been created with the purpose of learning to use JUnit and EasyMock Objects for the testing parts. I aldo learned how to apply Test-Driven Development methodolog.
